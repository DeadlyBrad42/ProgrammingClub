We are going to break from tradition and do a challenge from something other one from "Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual".  Next month's challenge is brought to you by the great people at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).  

From: https://projecteuler.net/problem=18 & https://projecteuler.net/problem=67
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

```
              3
             7 4
            2 4 6
           8 5 9 3
```
That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.



Attached are two files to test your code against.  p018_triangle.txt is one that you could technically complete the task using brute force calculations, but p067_triangle.txt is one that will not allow you to do that.  We want to solve the larger file for our challenge.
